# Control Strategies for Trajectory Tracking - Comparative Study

This project presents a comparative study of multiple
control strategies for trajectory tracking in autonomous
mobile robots. Leveraging 2D LIDAR-based SLAM for
trajectory generation, we evaluate the performance of
six controllersâ€”PID, PD, MPC, Fast MPC, LQR, and
LQGâ€”under varying speed conditions. The analysis
focuses on tracking accuracy using cross track error as
the key performance metric. Our findings offer insights
into the trade-offs between classical and optimal control
methods, highlighting their respective strengths, limita-
tions, and suitability for real-world navigation tasks.
